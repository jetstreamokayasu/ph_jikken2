This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
torus350<-torus350_incolle_set[[2]][[13]][["noizyX"]] %>%
  dplyr::as_data_frame() %>% 
  cbind(., c(rep(1, 300), rep(2, 283)))
colnames(torus350)[4]<-"inter"
plotly::plot_ly(torus350, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, size = 1, split= ~inter, width = 800, height=800) %>% 
plotly::add_markers()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
